## Usage

### Basic Setup

Below is a simple example of setting up AnythingProxy to route HTTP traffic:

```javascript
const AnythingProxy = require('anythingproxy');

const config = {
  port: 8080,
  routes: [
    {
      path: "/api",
      target: "http://localhost:3000"
    }
  ]
};

const proxy = new AnythingProxy(config);
proxy.start(() => {
  console.log(`AnythingProxy is running on port ${config.port}`);
});
```

### Advanced Configuration

AnythingProxy allows for advanced configuration to suit more complex scenarios. Below is an example of load balancing and custom routing rules:

```javascript
const AnythingProxy = require('anythingproxy');

const config = {
  port: 8080,
  routes: [
    {
      path: "/api",
      targets: [
        "http://backend1:3000",
        "http://backend2:3000"
      ],
      loadBalancing: "round-robin"
    },
    {
      path: "/admin",
      target: "http://adminserver:4000",
      auth: {
        type: "basic",
        users: {
          "admin": "password123"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  rateLimiting: {
    "/api": {
      maxRequests: 100,
      timeWindow: "1m"
    }
  }
};

const proxy = new AnythingProxy(config);
proxy.start(() => {
  console.log(`AnythingProxy is running on port ${config.port}`);
});
```
